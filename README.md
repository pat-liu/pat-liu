# Heya there! 👋 😬

I'm a junior studying computer science and statistics at the University of Pennsylvania! I'm interested in full-stack development 💻, making aesthetic applications ✨, ML and AI 🧠, and karaoke 🎤 (I sing as a Tenor in Penn's [Disney A Cappella](https://disneyacappella.com).

I'm a past SDE intern [@Amazon](https://amazon.com) and SWE intern [@HubSpot](https://hubspot.com), and a current Teaching Assistant for [CIS 120: Programming Languages and Techniques](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/21fa/staff/). I'm currently working on [berri](https://berri.io) 🍓 with some friends to help make the current virtual experience a little better 😊.
