# Heya there! 👋 😬

I'm a sophomore studying computer science and statistics at the University of Pennsylvania! I'm interested in full-stack development 💻, making aesthetic applications ✨, ML and AI 🧠, and karaoke 🎤 (I sing as a Tenor in Penn's Disney A Cappella–yep, we only sing Disney songs)!

I'm an incoming SDE intern [@Amazon](amzn) and an incoming SWE intern [@HubSpot](HubSpot). I'm currently working on berri 🍓 (at berri.io) with some friends to help make the current virtual experience a little better 😊.
