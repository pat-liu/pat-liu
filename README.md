# Heya there! 👋 😬

I'm a sophomore studying computer science and statistics at the University of Pennsylvania! I'm interested in full-stack development 💻, making aesthetic applications ✨, ML and AI 🧠, and karaoke 🎤 (I sing as a Tenor in Penn's [Disney A Cappella](https://disneyacappella.com/)–yep, we only sing Disney songs)!

I'm an incoming SDE intern [@Amazon](https:/amazon.com/)  and an incoming SWE intern [@HubSpot](https:/hubspot.com/) . I'm currently working on [berri](https:/berri.io/) 🍓 with some friends to help make the current virtual experience a little better 😊.
